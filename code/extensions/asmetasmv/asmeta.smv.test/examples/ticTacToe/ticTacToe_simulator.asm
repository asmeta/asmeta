//It permits to play Tic-Tac-Toe with the computer.
//At each step, the user and the computer, alternatively, make a move.
//The move of the user is specified through the monitored functions userChoiceX
//and userChoiceY.
//The computer makes its move using a choose rule.
//The board is represented by the binary function "board". An undef location
//represents an empty cell.
