asm gameOfLife

//The version described in the ASM book is slightly different.

//This is the version described in Wikipedia

//The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
//grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead.
//Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
//vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
//1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
//2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
//3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
//4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

//The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is
//created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births
//and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens
//is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the
//preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
