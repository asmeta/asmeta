# Configuration file for an ASM-based simulation. It defines, for each model and for the environment,
# the runtime ASM model paths, host and registry addresses, ZeroMQ endpoints,
# port pools used for publisher sockets, subscribed roles, and the environment functions together with their concrete test.
# These specifications are used by the runtime to instantiate the models,
#configure the communication channels among them, and drive the environment
# behaviour during the simulation; publisher socket fields may be left blank to allow dynamic port assignment at startup.
