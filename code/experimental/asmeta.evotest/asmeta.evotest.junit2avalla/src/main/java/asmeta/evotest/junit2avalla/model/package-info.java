/**
 * This package provides the object models used in this application.
 * 
 * A key component of this package is the {@code terms} subpackage, which
 * contains the models for both Java and Avalla terms. These terms play a
 * critical role in processing and defining scenarios. The Java terms represent
 * constructs specific to Java, while the Avalla terms capture elements unique
 * to Avalla, enabling translation and integration between the two domains.
 * 
 * 
 * The package also includes the {@link Scenario} class, which consist in a
 * queue of an Avalla terms, representing a parsed scenario. Furthermore it
 * includes the {@link ScenarioFile} class that models a file in the Avalla
 * format. This class encapsulates the content of an Avalla file as a textual
 * object.
