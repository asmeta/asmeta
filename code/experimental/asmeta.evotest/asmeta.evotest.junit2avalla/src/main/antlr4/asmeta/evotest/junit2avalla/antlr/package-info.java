/**
 * This package contains the grammar file {@code JavaScenario.g4} used to define
 * the rules for the lexer and parser, enabling the decomposition of incoming
 * JUnit files into tokens. It also includes all the autogenerated files
 * required to support the parsing operations, generated by the ANTLR plugin.
 * such as the the {@link JavaScenarioBaseListener} class, which serves as a
 * base class for creating custom listeners through inheritance, and the
 * {@link JavaScenarioLexer}, {@link JavaScenarioParser}, and
 * {@link JavaScenarioListener} classes, which are essential for parsing and
 * processing operations.
