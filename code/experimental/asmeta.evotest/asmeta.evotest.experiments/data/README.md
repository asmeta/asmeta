## Data

This folder contains the report files generated by the experiments, please use the format `/exp_/<experiment_number>` to create the folders.


The `Report_Analysis.ipynb` file can be used via [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) and allows you to perform a graphical analysis of the report files, it automatically takes the files from GitHub following the specified format of the folders, so you only need to indicate the experiment number.

The `README.md` file inside each experiment folder specifies the configuration parameters used for the experiment in question.
