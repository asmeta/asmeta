These are the features of the models

- with integers (not concrete, unbounded)
- with integers but bounded (with concrete subsetof) - transable to NuSMV
- with a big domain but still transable to NuSMV
- with structured domain like list ...
- with strings (monitored? e controlled)
- with a condition like a password or a pin difficult to gues (no nusmv)
- with a condition like a password or a pin difficult to gues (with nusmv) - like safe , open with a combination
- with enumerative
- with boolean and complex conditions
- types of rules: forall, macro with parameters
- one with a choose (it can be flaky) with internal non determinism
- with agents????
- with an asm that imports another rmodule
- with invariants (invariant - INVAR .... qui con INVAR ATGT potrebbe generare test che soddisfano gli inviarinti) - ferryman
- with reals
- 


requisito: ogni specifica copre una combinazione di features che la stessa identica o inclusa ? non viene coperta da altre modelli
