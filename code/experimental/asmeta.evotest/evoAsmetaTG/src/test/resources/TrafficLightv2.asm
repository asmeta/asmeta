/*
 * The model includes four states, red, green, yellow, and pending, and an internal variable count.
 * The time is explicit, i.e., each transition consumes a unit of time (seconds for instance). 
 * The system starts in red and waits 60s seconds checking the variable count and then moves to green. 
 * Then, the system waits for pedestrians.
 * When a pedestrian arrives, if the count is less than 60s, the system goes to pending,
 * letting the pedestrian wait for the count to reach 60.
 * Instead, if the traffic light was green for at least 60s, the light becomes yellow for 5 seconds before going to red.
 * The EFSM has also outputs that correspond to light colours.
