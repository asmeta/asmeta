asm petriNet_forModelAdvisor_InconsUpdateViolation3

//for the chapter "Formal semantics for Domain Specific Languages" of the book
//"Formal and Practical Aspects of Domain-Specific Languages: Recent Developments",
//publisher "IGI Global" 

//petri net with edge weight, place capacity and
//avoiding the use of seq in the firing of the transition.

//the edges are described with two matrices (two boolean functions)

//version for the ModelAdvisor:
//- the rule r_fire is wrong since it can update simultaneously the location tokens($p)
//  of a place $p that is both an input and an output place.

//It's difficult to discover the inconsistent update with the simulation:
//- you have to make three steps
//- 87,5% of the runs with three steps do not discover the inconsistency
