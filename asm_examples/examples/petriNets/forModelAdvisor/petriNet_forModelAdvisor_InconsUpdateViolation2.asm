asm petriNet_forModelAdvisor_InconsUpdateViolation2

//for the chapter "Formal semantics for Domain Specific Languages" of the book
//"Formal and Practical Aspects of Domain-Specific Languages: Recent Developments",
//publisher "IGI Global" 

//petri net with edge weight, place capacity and
//avoiding the use of seq in the firing of the transition.

//the edges are described with two matrices (two boolean functions)

//version for the ModelAdvisor:
//- the rule r_fire is wrong since it can update simultaneously the location tokens($p)
//  of a place $p that is both an input and an output place.

//Example taken from the slides "retiDiPetri.pdf" (on Zotero).
//Slightly less trivial than petriNetEdgeWeightNoPlaceCapacity_NoSeq_Matrix, but
//again it can be easily discovered with simulation in one step.
