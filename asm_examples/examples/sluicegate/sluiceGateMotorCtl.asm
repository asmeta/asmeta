//Sluice Gate Control
//from paper "The Abstract State Machines Method for High-Level System Design and Analysis" by Egon Boerger
//first refinement

//A small sluice, with a rising and falling gate, is used in a simple
//irrigation system. A computer system is needed to control the sluice
//gate: the requirement is that the gate should be held in the fully open
//position for ten minutes in every three hours and otherwise kept in
//the fully closed position.
//The gate is opened and closed by rotating vertical screws. The screws
//are driven by a small motor, which can be controlled by clockwise,
//anticlockwise, on and off pulses.
