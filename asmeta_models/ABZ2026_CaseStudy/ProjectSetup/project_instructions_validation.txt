The file TutorialAsmeta.pdf is a tutorial of the ASMETA formal method. It describes how systems should be modeled by using the AsmetaL notation and how validation-based scenario is performed by using the Avalla language.
Further information on the AsmetaL language, together with its own metamodel are available at https://asmeta.github.io/material/AsmetaL_quickguide.html

Additional information on the ASMETA framework, and on the purpose of each activity is described in the file FestschriftEgon75_cameraReady.pdf.
The StandardLibrary.asm includes standard domains and functions. All domains not defined there should be defined in the specification.

The description of the case study under development is given within the document-v2.pdf, while the simplified architecture of the subportion of the system we consider is given in the Architecture.pdf file.

Please consider the ASMETA models in BatteryMonitor.asm, ComputePlan2Charging.asm, GoalReasoningAgent.asm, HardwareInterface.asm, RoverDomains.asm, RoverReducedMain.asm, SolarPanelController.asm. These are the models under validation and all functions are defined there.

You should consider the information coming from these source documents to derive ASMETA models and Avalla scenarios.
