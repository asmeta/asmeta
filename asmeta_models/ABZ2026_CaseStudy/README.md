###ABZ 2026 Case Study - Replication Package for: "Can Large Language Models Support Modeling Systems with ASMETA? A Case Study with a Planetary Rover"

This package contains the ASMETA models, Avalla scenarios, and the prompts injected to ChatGPT for the
[ABZ 2026](https://abz-conf.org/site/2026/) Case Study paper "Can Large Language Models Support Modeling Systems with ASMETA? A Case Study with a Planetary Rover".

It contains:
- All versions of ASMETA (.asm) models produced and refined during the study;
- Avalla (.avalla) executable validation scenarios;
- Prompt files (.txt) injected into ChatGPT.

####Repository Structure

To reflect the iterative nature of the workflow, the repository is organized into numbered version folders (e.g., Version_01, Version_02, ...), presented in chronological order.

Each version folder corresponds to a modeling or validation iteration and may contain the following subfolders:
- `models/`: ASMETA models corresponding to that iteration.
- `scenarios/`: Avalla scenarios associated with that iteration.
- `prompts/`: The prompts used to generate or refine models and scenarios with the LLM during that iteration.

The versions currently included are:
- `Version_01_InitialGeneration/`: Initial model generation with ChatGPT from the natural-language requirements.
- `Version_02_SecondGeneration/`: Model refinement and fixes performed with ChatGPT after manual inspection and compiler feedback on Version_01.
- `Version_03_ManualFixes/`: Manual refinements after inspection of Version_02, without LLM support.
- `Version_04_Validation/`: Refinements following simulation, animation, and scenario-based validation. This version also includes the generated scenarios:
		* five randomly generated scenarios produced via ASMETA random test generation (folder `abstracttests/`);
		* the scenario generated by ChatGPT and the corresponding manually corrected versions (folder `scenarios_gpt/`).
	
#####Project Setup

The `ProjectSetup/` folder contains the material used to configure and guide the ChatGPT project environment.

It includes two instruction files:
- `project_instructions_modeling.txt`: instructions provided during the modeling phase.
- `project_instructions_validation.txt`: updated instructions provided once the validation phase was reached, specifying which models should be considered for validation activities.

In addition, the folder contains the reference artifacts supplied to the project as background knowledge:
- `StandardLibrary.asm`: the ASMETA standard library.
- `document_v2.pdf`: the document describing the ABZ 2026 case study.
- `TutorialAmeta.pdf`: the tutorial on the ASMETA language.
- `FestschriftEgon75.pdf`: the Festschrift paper for Egon Börger describing the phases and activities of the ASMETA-based development process.
- `Architecture.pdf`: the document containing the architecture of the subset of components targeted in the case study.
